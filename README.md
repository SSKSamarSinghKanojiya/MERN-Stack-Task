MERN Stack Machine Test
This project is a combination of a To-Do App and an Employee Management System, where an Admin can manage employees and assign tasks. The goal of this test is to evaluate your full-stack development skills in the MERN stack by implementing authentication, CRUD operations, and task management functionalities.

Tasks to Complete
Admin Authentication (Mandatory)
Implement JWT-based authentication (Login only)
Secure routes using authentication middleware

Employee Management (CRUD) 
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for employees
Store employee details:
Name, Email, Phone, Department, Status (Active/Inactive)
Display employee list with a search feature

Task Management (CRUD)
CRUD operations for tasks
Tasks should have Title, Description, Assigned Employee, Priority, Deadline, Status (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
Implement task assignment functionality (Admin assigns tasks to employees)
Admin should be able to update task status

Dashboard & UI Enhancements 
Create an Admin Dashboard displaying:
Total Employees, Total Tasks, Pending Tasks, Completed Tasks
UI should be responsive and visually appealing

Technical Requirements
Frontend (React.js)
Use React.js with functional components
State management using Redux or Context API
UI Framework: Tailwind CSS / Material UI
Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
Express.js to handle API requests
MongoDB & Mongoose for database operations
JWT for authentication

Evaluation Criteria
Code Structure & Best Practices
Efficient API Development & CRUD Operations
Authentication (Only Admin)
State Management & API Integration
Error Handling & Data Validation
UI/UX Quality & Responsiveness

Additional Notes
Use GitHub for version control (Push your code to a public repo)
Deploy using Vercel / Netlify (Frontend) and Render / Railway (Backend) (Bonus points)
